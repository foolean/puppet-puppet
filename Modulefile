description 'Manage puppet agents as well as the puppetmaster.  Puppetmaster
invocations have the option of running the standard webbrick (the default)
or passenger.  Multuple environments are created to provide a three-tiered 
development architecture.  This module also provides the ability to manage
multiple environments for the purposes of providing puppet services to
disparate sites resulting in CM as a service. (see CAVEAT in the README)'
