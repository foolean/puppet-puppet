puppet

This module handles the management of puppet agents as well as the
puppetmaster.  Puppetmaster invocations have the option of running
the standard webrick (the default) or passenger.  Multiple environ-
ments are created to provide for a three-tiered development archit-
ecture.  These environments create 'production', 'development', and
individual 'developer' areas.   This module also provides for the
management of additional environments for the purposes of providing
puppet services to multiple sites (see CAVEAT below).


Example
-------

   node myagent {
       class { 'puppet':
           mode => 'agent',
       }
   }

   # accomplishes the same thing done for 'myagent' above
   node myotheragent {
       class { 'puppet': }
   }

   # Agent with different tidying requirements
   node smallagent {
       class { 'puppet':
           tidy_age => '4w',
       }
   }

   node mymaster {
       class { 'puppet':
           mode    => 'master',
           clients => [ 'host1', 'host2', etc ],
           modules => [
               'foolean-ssh'
           ],
       }
   }

   # A puppetmaster with different tidying requirements (5yrs)
   node mylongtermmaster {
       class { 'puppet':
           mode     => 'master',
           clients  => [ 'host1', 'host2', etc ],
           tidy_age => '260w',
           modules  => [
               'foolean-ssh'
           ],
       }
   }

   # A puppetmaster running passenger
   node myothermaster {
       class { 'puppet':
           mode       => 'passenger',
           workers    => 5,
           clients    => [ 'host1', 'host2', etc ],
           developers => [ 'user1', 'user2', etc ],
           modules    => [
               'foolean-ssh'
           ],
       }
   }

   # A puppetmaster running passenger and multiple sites
   node mysitemaster {
       class { 'puppet':
           mode       => 'passenger',
           workers    => 5,
           clients    => [ 'host1', 'host2', etc ],
           developers => [ 'user1', 'user2', etc ],
           modules    => [
               'foolean-ssh'
           ],
           sites   => {
               'site1' => {
                   'clients'    => [ 'host1', 'host2', etc ],
                   'developers' => [ 'user1', 'user2', etc ],
               },
               'site2' => {
                   'clients'    => [ 'host1', 'host2', etc ],
                   'developers' => [ 'user1', 'user2', etc ],
               },
           },
       }
   }



CAVEAT EMPTOR!
--------------

******************************************************
*** DO NOT USE MORE THAN ONE SITE PER PUPPETMASTER ***
*** IF YOU NEED TO MAINTAIN PRIVACY BETWEEN SITES! ***
******************************************************

Puppet allows for the execution of arbitrary ruby code on the puppetmaster.
This can be accomplished in manifest files by using the inline_template
function or in template files themselves.  The arbitrary code will execute
in the context of the puppet daemon, typically uid:puppet, gid:puppet.  While
it limits the scope of readable and writable files over the entire file system
it does also mean that any file puppet can read so can anyone with the rights
to upload manifests and templates.  Because of this "feature" there is no way
to ensure privacy between sites.

    Manifest Example:

    # Grab the puppet.conf file (extra vars to ease 80-char wrapping)
    $config_file = "${settings::confdir}/${settings::config_file_name}"
    $foo = inline_template( "<%= %x{ cat ${config_file} } %>" ) 
    notify { 'show-foo': message => $foo }

    Template Example
    <%=
        %x{
            hostname -f;
            id ;
            pwd;
            echo "#"
            echo "# uid=puppet and writable"
            find / -type f -user puppet -perm -u=w  -ls
            echo "#"
            echo "# gid=puppet and writable"
            find / -type f -group puppet -perm -g=w  -ls
            echo "#"
            echo "# world writable"
            find / -type f -perm -o=w -ls
            echo "#"
            echo "# facter information"
            facter
        }
    %>



About this module
-----------------

Q. Shouldn't the Apache2 controls be in an Apache module instead of here?

This is an experiment to see if it is posisble to have this class be
indepedent of any other classes.  Ordinarily functionality such as the
Apache2 controls would be handled by an Apache module so that enhancements
will be carried through to all classes who utilize it.  The a2ensite,
a2dissite, and a2enmod defines are innocuous enough that their structure
should not need to change.   It is also the hopes of this module that
it will not conflict with other Apache modules.  In the future, a Foolean
Apache module will be created.  This module may depend on the Apache
module only if conflicts can not be avoided.   In the end, this is all
an attempt to publish useful modules without having to foist additional
modules upon the adopter.



Requirements
------------

This module requires puppet version 2.7 or greater.

For CentOS and RedHat this can be found on the RepoForge site as the EPEL site
is still publishing v2.6.18

Note: Even as of SLES 11-SP3, Novell SUSE is still using v2.6.18.



Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------

Primary development is done on Debian and then validated against other
operating systems.  The current list of supported operating systems is:

    * Debian

    puppet::master::bootstrap is known to work on:

    * CentOS
    * Debian
    * Fedora
    * OpenSUSE
    * RedHat
    * Ubuntu



Directory Structure
-------------------

To facilitate host multiple sites, this module creates and relies on the
following directory structure.

    ${settings::vardir}/sites
    `-- default
        |-- development
        |   |-- manifests
        |   |   `-- site.pp
        |   |-- modules
        |   |   |-- puppet
        |   |   `-- [ other modules ]
        |   `-- private
        |       `-- [ fqdn ]
        |-- developers
        |   `-- [ developer ]
        |       |-- manifests
        |       |   `-- site.pp
        |       |-- modules
        |       |   |-- puppet
        |       |   `-- [ other modules ]
        |       `-- private
        |           `-- [ fqdn ]
        `-- production
            |-- manifests
            |   `-- site.pp
            |-- modules
            |   |-- puppet
            |   `-- [ other modules ]
            |-- private
                `-- [ fqdn ]



File and Directory Permissions
------------------------------

Puppet, by default, will attempt to manage the permissions and ownership
of the various files within the $vardir structure.  In doing so a number
of the objects will end up with world readable permissions and ownership
other than the puppet user or group.  In order to allow this module to
manage the permissions and ownership the 'manage_internal_file_permissions'
options is set to 'false' in the main configuration block of puppet.conf.

This module will then to remove all 'world' permissions and set ownership
to the puppet user and puppet group as there is really no reason for any
other users to access the puppet files.   The premis is that only an
administrator (e.g. someone with root) should be running puppet on a
system.  Likewise only an administrator or someone in the puppet group
should be looking at any of the puppet files.

Even with all of this there are still a couple of areas where puppet
itself still tries to enforce ownership.



Prerun and Postrun commands
---------------------------

This module uses a cron.d like format to handle prerun and postrun commands.
Scripts should be placed in either $confdir/pre-run.d or $confdir/post-run.d.
The 'rundir' script will execute any executable script found in the respective
directory.  This enables modules to add pre and post run processing much in
the same manner that cron.d is handled.  Script precedence can be achieved by
adding numerical prefixes such as pre-run.d/00_etckeeper.

   Example:
   prerun_command = /etc/puppet/rundir pre
   postrun_command = /etc/puppet/rundir post

NOTE:
   The 'rundir' script utilizes the PUPPET_NOOP variable, which is set
   by the facter script isnoop.rb to skip the running of the prerun and
   postrun scripts when running with --noop turned on.

CAUTION:
   This will run any executable script found in the pre and post run
   directories.  It is for this reason that only root should be allowed
   to write into them.  Allowing the puppet user to write into these
   directories will allow anyone with the ability to add recipees to
   the system to run arbitrary code on the agents.  Like cron.d these
   will, more often than not, get run as root so care should be taken
   regarding the content that gets added.



Packaging
---------

Creating the package (tarball) that can be installed using puppet's module
function is simple.  Run the following command while in the top of the module
directory (e.g. /usr/src/puppet-puppet).

    puppet module build .

The resulting tarball will be named foolean-puppet-$VER.tar.gz and can be found
in the "pkg" directory within the source tree.


PuppetForge Installation
------------------------

Foolean Puppet is on PuppetLab's PuppetForge making installation as simple as:

    puppet module install foolean/puppet


Manual Installation
-------------------

When we're installing from a tarball the installation and upgrade process
is the same.  You'll need to set --modulepath if f you're installing the
module in a path other than the location defined in puppet.conf.

    MODULEPATH=/var/lib/puppet/modules
    puppet module install         \
        --force                   \
        --ignore-dependencies     \
        --module-path $MODULEPATH \
        $PATHTO/foolean-puppet-$VER.tar.gz


Bootstrapping
-------------

When going for complete deterministic installations we will quickly find
ourselves in chicken/egg territory.  We use puppet to ensure determinism
in our systems but how do we get puppet onto a new puppetmaster when an
existing puppetmaster doesn't exist?  That is the purpose of the 
"bootstrap.pp" file.  The first time the operating system comes up after
install the following steps can be run to bootstrap the puppetmaster.

    # install puppet
    apt-get install puppet

    # retrieve the bootstrap.pp file
    wget https://raw.github.com/foolean/puppet-puppet/master/manifests/master/bootstrap.pp

    # run the bootstrap process (add --noop if you want to review first)
    puppet apply --detailed-exitcodes --verbose ./bootstrap.pp

    # run puppet again to configure the system as a puppetmaster
    puppet agent --test
