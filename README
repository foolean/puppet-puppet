puppet

This module handles the management of puppet agents as well as the
puppetmaster.  This module also provides for the management of additional
environments for the purposes of providing puppet services to disparate
sites.  This essentially provides for CM as a service.


Example
-------

    node myagent {
        class { 'puppet':
            mode => 'agent',
        }
    }

    # accomplishes the same thing done for 'myagent' above
    node myotheragent {
        class { 'puppet': }
    }

    node mymaster {
        class { 'puppet':
            mode  => 'master',
            sites => {
                'site1' => {
                    clients    => [ 'host1', 'host2', etc ],
                },
            },
        }

        puppet::module { 'foolean::ssh': }
    }


About this module
-----------------

Q. Why is there a master/defaults.pp.example file?

The defaults.pp file is the central place where the 'main', 'agent', and
'master' configuration blocks are kept.  The classes rely on a the central
configurations to make life a little bit easier and I didn't want future
module upgrades to destroy any custom configurations an admin may have
created.

Q. Why not use Heira?

Future versions may, in fact, become Heira aware.


Directory Structure
-------------------

To facilitate host multiple sites, this module creates and relies on the
following directory structure.

    ${settings::vardir}/sites
    `-- default
        |-- development
        |   |-- manifests
        |   |   `-- site.pp
        |   |-- modules
        |   |   |-- puppet
        |   |   `-- [ other modules ]
        |   |-- private
        |       `-- [ fqdn ]
        `-- production
            |-- manifests
            |   `-- site.pp
            |-- modules
            |   |-- puppet
            |   `-- [ other modules ]
            |-- private
                `-- [ fqdn ]


Requirements
------------

This module requires puppet version 2.7 or greater.

For CentOS and RedHat this can be found on the RepoForge site as the EPEL site
is still publishing v2.6.18

Note: Even as of SLES 11-SP3, Novell SUSE is still using v2.6.18.


Packaging
---------

Creating the package (tarball) that can be installed using puppet's module
function is simple.  Run the following command while in the top of the module
directory (e.g. /usr/src/puppet-puppet).

    puppet module build .

The resulting tarball will be named foolean-puppet-$VER.tar.gz and can be found
in the "pkg" directory within the source tree.


PuppetForge Installation
------------------------

Foolean Puppet is on PuppetLab's PuppetForge making installation as simple as:

    puppet module install foolean/puppet


Manual Installation
-------------------

When we're installing from a tarball the installation and upgrade process
is the same.  You'll need to set --modulepath if f you're installing the
module in a path other than the location defined in puppet.conf.

    MODULEPATH=/var/lib/puppet/modules
    puppet module install         \
        --force                   \
        --ignore-dependencies     \
        --module-path $MODULEPATH \
        $PATHTO/foolean-puppet-$VER.tar.gz


Bootstrapping
-------------

When going for complete deterministic installations we will quickly find
ourselves in chicken/egg territory.  We use puppet to ensure determinism
in our systems but how do we get puppet onto a new puppetmaster when an
existing puppetmaster doesn't exist?  That is the purpose of the 
"bootstrap.pp" file.  The first time the operating system comes up after
install the following steps can be run to bootstrap the puppetmaster.

    # install puppet
    apt-get install puppet

    # retrieve the bootstrap.pp file
    wget https://raw.github.com/foolean/puppet-puppet/master/manifests/master/bootstrap.pp

    # run the bootstrap process (add --noop if you want to review first)
    puppet apply --detailed-exitcodes --verbose ./bootstrap.pp

    # run puppet again to configure the system as a puppetmaster
    puppet agent --test


To Do
-----
    * Add passenger support

    * Add deeper ownership and mode management on puppet files and directories
